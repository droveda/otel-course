# Logs
* Log is a time-stamped record of events or messages generated by an application.
* It captures information about what the application is doing.
  * Requests the application receives
  * Errors or failures encountered
  * Business decisions or actions taken by the application, along with the context or conditions that led to them.

Note: Why do we need logging when we have distributed tracing?  
* Imagine a complex e-commerce application with many business rules.
  * Customer 1 request a product refund -> refund is approved
  * Customer 2 request a product refund -> refund is denied

1. The tracing shows what happened and how long it took
2. The log explains why the decision was made


### Challenges
* Multiple services
* Multiple instances
* Multi-threaded execution
* Request Correlation

### Goal
* Collect logs from all services and instances into a centralized system using the opentelemetry collector
* Correlate logs with specific requests or transactions for easier debugging
* Visualize and explore logs in Grafana
* Achieve this without changing existing logging code, making observability seamless in a distributed environment
